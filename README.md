This is a fork of Cabbibo’s “BallGamne”, an earlier build of “Blarp!”.
https://github.com/cabbibo/BallGamne

Please thank Cabbibo for his generosity with this open source by purchasing “Blarp!” on Steam: http://store.steampowered.com/app/420840/

I’m calling this fork “Blarp-d” as I’ve added initial support for co-op play with a Vive Tracker (downloadable build forthcoming) - see commit for more info.

Now either have a friend with a tracker help you avoid getting Blarp’d or make it more challenging.

Cleaned up build to work with Unity 5.5.2 and SteamVR Unity plugin 1.2 (1.2.1 is ok too)
